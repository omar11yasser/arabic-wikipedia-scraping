# Wikepedia arabic articles scrapping

In this project I intend to create a scraping tool for wikepedia where the scrapper get the paragraphs in a certain article as well as collecting all the hyperlinks for other articles inside the body and store them in a Dataframe. In a future version I will add the ability to scrap the links I collect to create a dataset of many articles relevant to the first article I started with.

Please use this code responsibly and review wikepedia's rules for scrapping to check the legality and the effect of this method before usage.
