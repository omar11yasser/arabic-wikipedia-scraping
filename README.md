# Wikepedia arabic articles scrapping

In this project I intend to create a scraping tool for wikepedia where the scrapper get the paragraphs in a certain article as well as collecting all the hyperlinks for other articles inside the body and store them in a Dataframe.
The second commit added the ability to get all the article's categories listed under 'تصنيفات'.

Please keep in mind that the repo is not in it's final form and still under development.

## Future additions
In a future version I will add the ability to scrap the links I collect to create a dataset of many articles relevant to the first article I started with.
Also, I will add support to save all the data inside a json file so it is more structured to be used in training models.

A python script will be available in the future to use the included functionality with ease.

Please use this code responsibly and review wikepedia's rules for scrapping to check the legality and the effect of this method before usage.
